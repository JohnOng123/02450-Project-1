**Project Overview**

This project involves performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the USA wood dataset. 

The analysis focuses on how different wood properties correlate and contribute to the variance within the dataset. 

Different key factors that categorize and differentiate wood types are identified, with visualizations of PCA results (eg. projections and variance explained).

Comparative analysis is also performed using different standardization methods. 


NOTE: 
- This analysis removes rows with missing data, which might not be the most efficient way of handling missing data
- Heat maps for correlation can be added in the future.
- Plots for distribution analysis can be added in the future.
